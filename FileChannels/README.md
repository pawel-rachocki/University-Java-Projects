Task: File Channels

The directory {user.home}/TPO1dir contains text files located in this directory and its various subdirectories. The file encoding is Cp1250. By recursively browsing the directory tree, starting from {user.home}/TPO1dir, read these files and append their contents to a file named TPO1res.txt located in the project's root directory. The program should create the TPO1res.txt file if it does not exist in the project structure. The encoding of the TPO1res.txt file must be UTF-8. Each time the program is run, the TPO1res.txt file should be cleared before loading data from the files.

Notes:

    Create a class definition named Futil.
    Use FileVisitor to browse the directories and FileChannel for file read/write operations.Task: File Channels
